After what seemed like recursive refactors and last minute push to get some tests created. The initial release of the golang rewrite is live. A bug in the updater has already been fixed. Accompanying this release is a sweet new [docs site](https://defektive.github.io/xodbox). Lack of docs was a huge shortcoming of the node version.

Development efforts will now be focused on automatic TLS cert creation.
